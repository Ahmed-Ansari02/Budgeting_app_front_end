#Frontend for Budgeting app:
 
##About:
This is the front for the budgeting app I made using React.js. The app makes uses of google Oauth library to login a user and store their data. The user is then prompted to add their data on a seperate web page. The user can also view their recorded expenses in the expenses tab which displays a breakdown of the users expenses based on differnet categories and months. This information is displaced using an insightful spending summary box and charts made through recharts library.

##Technologies used:
1) React.js
2) Framer Motion
3) Recharts
4) Google Oauth
5) JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
